module summary 


1. what is express ?
Express.js is node.js framework - package that adds a bunch of utility functions and tools and a clear set of rules on how the app should be built(middleware)

it's highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it(middleware)

2. Routing 
You can filter requests by path and method 

if you filter by method, paths are matched exactly. otherwise, the first segment of a URL is matched. 
You can use the express.Router to split your routes across files elegantly.

3. middleware,next(), and res() 
Express.js relies heavily on middleware functions - you can easily add them by calling use()

middleware functions handle a request and should call next() to forward the request to the next functions in line or send a response 

4. serve Files 
You are not limited to serving dummy text as a response 
you can sendFile()s to your users e.g. HTML FILES 
if a request is directly made for a file(e.g. a .css file is requested), you can enable static serving for such files via express.static();
