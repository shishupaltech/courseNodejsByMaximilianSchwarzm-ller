// npm stands for "Node Package Manager" and it allows you to manage your Node project and its dependencies 
// you can initialize a project with npm init 
// npm scripts can be defined in the package.json to give you "shortcuts" to common tasks/ commands.

//                          3rd Party Packages 
// Node projects typically don't just use core modules and custom code but also third-party packages

// you install them via npm 
// you can differentiate between production dependencies (--save),development dependencies (--save-dev) and global dependencies(-g);

//                              types of Error 
// syntax, runtime and logical errors can break your app 
// syntax and runtime errors throw(helpful) error message(with line numbers)
// logical errors can be fixed with testing and the help of the debuger.

//                                      debuging
// Use the vs code node debuger to step into your code and go through it step by step 
// analyze variable values at runtime 
// look into (and manipulate) variables at runtime 
// set breakpoints cleverly (i.e. respect the sync/ event-driven nature);
